# java-media-keys
Java source file and dll file for pressing the "Volume Down", "Volume Up", "Volume Mute", "Previous Track", "Next Track", and "Play/Pause Track" keys on the keyboard.

MediaKeys.java must be in a package named "commands" to work.

MediaKeys.dll must be in the same path as the "src" folder or in the same path as the .class or .jar file when compiled.

MediaKeys.c and MediaKeys.h are the the source code files for the dll.

(The current MediaKeys.dll does not include the Media Stop command but Media Stop is included in the source code commented out; an updated .dll will be uploaded in the future)
